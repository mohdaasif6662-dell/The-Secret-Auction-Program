# 🕵️ Secret Auction Program

A simple **Python-based console application** that simulates a secret auction.  
Each bidder enters their name and bid privately, and once all bids are in, the program announces the winner with the highest bid.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Allows **multiple bidders** to participate secretly.
- Keeps bids **hidden** until all entries are done.
- Automatically determines and displays the **highest bidder**.
- Simple and easy to use — perfect for beginners learning Python loops and dictionaries.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Dictionaries for storing bidder data (`name: bid`)
- While loops for continuous input
- Functions for cleaner and modular code
- Conditional logic for winner determination

---

## 🧩 How It Works
1. The program welcomes users to the secret auction.
2. Each participant is asked for:
   - Their **name**
   - Their **bid amount**
3. After entering a bid, they’re asked if there are any more bidders.
   - If yes → the screen clears for privacy (optional).
   - If no → the program reveals the winner.
4. The **highest bidder** and **their bid amount** are displayed.
